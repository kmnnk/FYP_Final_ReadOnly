Files used during my final year project are in the folder 'CODE'. It contains files with code that can be used once data is loaded in at the top. 
Example optuna search code for 2D and 3D models is given (the line commented with 'dimensionality reduction' can be adjusted to accomodate a range of reductions, 
as well as already reduced data (using PCA/LDA)). The code used to do the significance testing is also given, the groups for this should be adjusted as required and a 
different test may need to be used depending on the data used.
